## Description

_{This is a work-in-progress, allowing me practice with Rails as well as an opportunity to reflect on my strengths, my personal interests, and how the skills and experiences I bring to the table allow me to offer something unique and hopefully valuable. }_

Today we'll focus on our strengths and personal interests not just as coders but as people and potential employees. Before you begin working on your portfolio site, take some time to reflect on your strengths. List these strengths in your README. Be as open-ended as you like. You can focus on being serious or add humor or take any other approach you like. Relevant experience at a past job could be an example of a serious strength. Being good at walking backwards with your eyes closed might not be something you put on your resume, but feel free to put it in your README. Expressing yourself creatively in this way might lead insights about strengths that could end up in your resume or portfolio site. These quirky details can also help convey a sense of who you are as a person, which might get a potential employer's attention.

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

_{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know?  Outline any issues that would impact use of your application.  Share any workarounds that are in place. }_

## Support and contact details

_{Let people know what to do if they run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns.  Encourage them to contact you or make a contribution to the code.}_

## Technologies Used
